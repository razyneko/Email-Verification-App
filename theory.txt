What This Code Does:
This program is an email domain verifier that checks a given domain for:
Whether it has MX (Mail Exchange) records, which are used for email delivery.
Whether it has an SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record, which is used to prevent email spoofing.
Whether it has a DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) record,
which improves email authentication.

What are MX, SPF, and DMARC records, and why are they important?

MX records specify the mail servers for a domain.
SPF records prevent email spoofing by defining authorized sending servers.
DMARC records enhance email authentication and provide reporting.
v=spf1 anf _dmarc -- conventions for storing spf and dmarc records

Why validSMTP: false Might Happen
SMTP Verification Limitations:

Some mail servers are configured to reject or ignore SMTP verification requests for security or anti-spam purposes.
Servers like Gmail often do not respond to SMTP VRFY or RCPT TO commands for email verification.
Firewall or Anti-Abuse Mechanisms:

The mail server may block your request because it sees the verification attempt as suspicious.
Rate-limiting or geographic restrictions might apply.
Temporary Server Issues:

The email server could be temporarily unavailable or experiencing downtime.
Your IP or Server Configuration:

If you're testing from a local machine, your IP might not have the proper reputation to query SMTP servers.
Some servers only respond to known or whitelisted IPs.
Incorrect Implementation of the SMTP Check:

If the smtp.Dial() or conn.Rcpt() commands are not handled correctly, the server might reject the request even for valid emails.
Catch-All Domain:

Some domains accept all email addresses (even invalid ones) and return false during validation because they cannot verify the specific address.
